Learn how to use a family of apply() functions. Pls use the book, this part: “Applying functions to matrices and data frames”. Research and answer what is the difference between: apply(), lapply(), tapply(), mapply(). Using data set advertisers_2013.csv and appropriate function from these apply(), lapply(), tapply(), mapply(), pls compute:

    mean of advertising spend in these categories MAGAZINE, NEWSPAPER, OUTDOOR, TV, RADIO, INTERNET, DISPLAY; find top 10 spenders in each category - chart them
    find top 10 advertisers who spend most of their budget in each category (for example, you could find that Macy's spend most of its budget on TV, so it will be one of top 10 in TV)

Learn a new package: plyr. Research how you can use function ddply(). Compute mean of advertising spend in these categories MAGAZINE, NEWSPAPER, OUTDOOR, TV, RADIO, INTERNET, DISPLAY, using ddply().
